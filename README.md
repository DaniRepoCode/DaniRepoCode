I am a Python Developer and Telecommunication Systems Engineer and during my free time I like to carry out small projects and personal goals through the development of new tools.

I am mainly interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, but I like learning about many other fields in computer science such as cryptography, software engineering and cybersecurity. I currently use Python as my main programming language as it is the most versatile and popular for ML/DL and my favorite tools/frameworks are:
